# pitchfork-scrape
Some friends were talking about this [article on Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/710-the-unbearable-whiteness-of-indie/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=general&utm_campaign=thepitch) (and [a response](http://www.rawkblog.net/2015/03/on-pitchfork-race-indie-rock/)), so of course I wanted to quantify things.

As of now, this scraper should pretty much grab and index Pitchfork coverage by artist. I've only run it on a sample of the 'A's but...

If one wanted to ascribe racial attributes to artists, then it gets complicated... but one thing at a time.
